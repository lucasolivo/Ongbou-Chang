            <h2>A Voice for Women</h2>
            <p>
                The cultures of the Eastern tribes are patriarchal societies. Males dominate in all the decision making. A male child is preferred over a female child. Socially and culturally, women don't have a voice when it comes to making decisions. In case of divorce or the death of a spouse or partner, women have no rights to the custody of the children nor of any assets.  Women especially in the remote areas suffer silently behind closed doors. Due to cultural and social sensitivity, women do not have access to sensitive healthcare services. Domestic abuse is a sensitive topic where many women suffer silently. 
            </p>
            <h2>Path to the Future</h2>
            <p>
                One main purpose of the foundation is to empower women with knowledge and resources in making decisions about their well-being. There is a need to bring access to education, development and healthcare in the most underserved rural areas. When these women are equipped with knowledge and resources to make decisions about their well-being, it also uplifts their families and communities. These women are held back as they donâ€™t have voices when it comes to making decisions for their well-being. Due to cultural sensitivity, many often suffer in silence at the hands of their abusers. The Ongbou Chang Education Foundation (OCEF) seeks to improve the education and health of women and to also raise the status of women.

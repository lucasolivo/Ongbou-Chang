        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <div class="section">

                    Ongbou Chang Education Foundation is a Non-Profit Organization. The main purpose of the foundation is for the advancement of education among the Chang Naga tribe of Nagaland. Nagaland is situated at the corner of Northeast India, bordering Myanmar. The physical appearance, culture and traditions of the Chang are very similar to people from other East Asian countries. Due to the remote location, it was closed to the rest of the world for many decades. With Google Maps and social media, only in recent decades, is it beginning to be discovered by the rest of the world.

                    The Naga tribes were head hunters. Nagas were animist and some pay homage to their ancestors like the Chang Nagas. In the mid 1880’s, American Baptist Missionaries came to the western and central Naga tribes. They brought with them Christianity and education. With the coming of Christianity, head hunting was stopped among those Naga tribes. Christianity came to the Chang Naga tribe only in the 1940’s, through the Ao Naga tribe. Chang Nagas were head hunters up to the 1950’s.

        <h2>Our Goals</h2>

            <div>
                <p>
                    The need for education in various fields in this remote area is vast. The foundation’s main purpose is to help in building schools, helping to run the school with community involvement, sponsor students in higher education, and educating the community and villages for the preservation of their languages, culture and tradition. With the coming of Christianity and western culture, young people are abandoning their language, culture and tradition. If it is not preserved in the near future, they will not have their own identity as a Chang Naga tribe.

                    Yentin Ongbou Chang was a pioneer in the field of education among the Chang Nagas. Even though he didn’t have western education, he saw the importance of western education. He set an example for the rest of his tribe, the importance of quality education. All of his eight children were educated in Catholic schools. All eight of them graduated from college from different universities in India and USA. This foundation was to honor him for his deep love for education. He served for over four decades as a government servant. He passed away in 2009.
